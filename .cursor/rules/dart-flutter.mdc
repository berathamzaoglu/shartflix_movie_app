# Dart & Flutter Conventions

## Dart Language Guidelines
- Use const constructors for immutable widgets
- Leverage Freezed for immutable state classes and unions
- Use arrow syntax for simple functions and methods
- Prefer expression bodies for one-line getters and setters
- Use trailing commas for better formatting and diffs
- Keep lines no longer than 80 characters, adding commas before closing brackets for multi-parameter functions

## Flutter-Specific
- Use const widgets where possible to optimize rebuilds
- Implement list view optimizations (e.g., ListView.builder)
- Use AssetImage for static images and cached_network_image for remote images
- Implement responsive design using LayoutBuilder or MediaQuery

## Code Style
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Prefer expression bodies for simple getters/setters
- Use trailing commas for better formatting
- Structure files: exported widget, subwidgets, helpers, static content, types

## Debugging
- Use `log` instead of `print` for debugging
- Use BlocObserver for monitoring state transitions during debugging
